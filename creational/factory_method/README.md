### Example from GoF book
This example uses the method as described in the Gang of Four (GOF) book. However, such usage is rarely encountered in real-life scenarios, practically never. The example itself contradicts its purpose. Its task is to reduce the number of dependencies, which it doesn't effectively accomplish.
Problem in this pattern are at we want to reduce dependencies from client code (main class) but is still have many dependencies.
